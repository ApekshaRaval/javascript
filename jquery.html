      Severe Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle was a tropical cyclone affecting New Zealand and Norfolk Island in February 2023. The fifth named storm of the 2022–23 Australian region cyclone season, and first severe tropical cyclone of the 2022–23 South Pacific cyclone season, Gabrielle was first noted as a developing tropical low on 6 February, while it was located to the south of the Solomon Islands before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Gabrielle by the Bureau of Meteorology. The system reached a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, before moving into the South Pacific basin, then rapidly degenerated into a subtropical low on 11 February. It is one of the most destructive cyclones since Cyclone Bola in 1988 and one of the most deadliest since Cyclone Giselle in 1968.
